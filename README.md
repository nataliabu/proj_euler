# My Solutions to Project Euler Problems

## About

Project Euler is a website dedicated to a series of computational problems. 

I started solving these in January 2021 as an exercise to keep improving my
mathematical and my programming skills.

## Structure

There is a folder for each problem which contains the description and my
solution to the problem.

After spending more time thinking and learning about certain problems, I have
sometimes found a better approach, so some of the folders contain more than one solution.
